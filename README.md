## Background information

AquaSentinel is a machine learning-driven anomaly-detection system designed for deep-sea diving prototype, developed as part of a 6-person multidisciplinary team for the 'Engineering: You're Hired!' university-wide competition. AquaSentinel is a component of our project 'VitaLink': a wearable armband that continuously monitors a diver’s vital signs and environmental conditions, leveraging AI-based anomaly detection to identify potential medical emergencies, and alerting both the diver and the surface team in case of one.

A shallow autoencoder Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture has been used to learn normal physiological patterns and detect deviations that could indicate distress. The model has been optimised for deployment on embedded devices with low power consumption and real-time inference capabilities.

## Run demo

- **Requires**
    - Python 3.10.9
    - numpy, matplotlib, tflite-runtime, tensorflow-cpu (if retraining)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
- **Running the program (inference)**:

```python
# To run the demo (inference)
python VitaLink-AquaSentintel.py
```

- **Running the program (retraining)**:
```python
# To retrain the model
pip install tensorflow-cpu
python VitaLink-AquaSentintel.py --train
```

- **Expected outputs**:
  - If training: saved `AquaSentintel.tflite` model rewriting repo one
  - Anomaly threshold value and reconstruction error values, and predicted/actual labels
  - Graph showing results of inference with anomaly threshold and all values' reconstruction errors plotted (3 successive program runs given at bottom of page)
  - Accuracy results (overall percentage, normal accuracy, anomaly accuracy)

## Core features

- **ML anomaly detection**  
  - Uses an autoencoder trained on synthetic normal physiological data to detect anomalies.
  - Identifies hypoxia-like conditions in divers based on heart rate and blood oxygen levels (anomalous data is also synthetic).
  - Chose optimiser, loss function, activation functions for encoding and decoding using comparative experiments between configurations prioritising lower validation loss and stability across epochs.
  - Model is slightly aggressive and, when presented with values at the threshold, errs on the side of anomalous in order to prioritise diver safety over false positives.

- **Optimised for edge computing**  
  - Converts the trained model to TFLite for deployment on microcontrollers.
  - Lightweight architecture with minimal computational overhead.
  - Uses in-memory execution rather than persistent storage (done for evaluation purposes; in a real-world deployment, persistent storage is needed to save the *.tflite model).

- **Evaluation and visualisation**
  - The autoencoder ANN was chosen after considering the input data and the accuracy of the classification needed, weighed against other models such as decision trees, support vector machines, and traditional statistical anomaly detection methods.
  - The autoencoder reconstructs an input sample, after which the reconstruction error (MSE between the original and reconstructed data) is calculated, with a pre-computed threshold used to classify the sample.

- **Using in-memory TFLite model**
  - Uses in-memory TFLite model instead of saving the model, making the program more efficient by skipping the disk I/O operation.
  - Persistent storage is not required (at this stage) since the model is loaded dynamically during execution.

## Limitations

- **Reproducibility constraints**
  - Reproducibility was attempted through random seeds and disabling oneDNN (which was causing nondeterminism due to floating-point round-off errors) but minor non-determinism still remains in TensorFlow's training operations. Due to timing constraints, scope of the problem, and the relatively small run-to-run accuracy fluctuations, this was not addressed further. Hackathon leaders further affirmed that this level of variance is expected for shallow models and does not affect the validity of the demo.
  - Overall accuracy fluctuations were observed to only be in the range of (96±3)%, with 85% of tests achieving 100% anomaly detection accuracy.
    - Of course, instances of 100% are only due to the simplicity of the data and model (more realistic readings/fluctuations would give lower metrics), though the current accuracy readings serve as a useful benchmark on the model's ease of improvement.

- **Limited feature set and simplified model**  
  - Currently detects only heart rate and blood oxygen anomalies, however this is expected for a prototype demonstration.
  - Later, the model would need to be expanded to encompass more vital signs (e.g., breathing patterns, temperature).
  - Further optimisations are required for real world deep-sea conditions.
